# iobeam Embedded C/C++ Library #

**[iobeam](http://iobeam.com)** is a data platform for
connected devices. 

This repository contains libraries for connecting to the **iobeam
Cloud** on embedded platforms such as Arduino and the TI CC3200.
For more information on the iobeam Cloud, please read our

## Platform READMEs ##

This repository contains code for several different platforms. We have
therefore broken down our documentation into separate READMEs for each:

1. [Arduino](docs/ARDUINO.md) - Using this library on the Arduino 
platform, such as the Arduino Uno device.

1. [TI CC3200](docs/CC3200.md) - Using this library with the TI CC3200
Laundpad.
